# Klippy
An iOS App for Klipper/Moonraker based 3D printers


Klippy is underdevelopment. My plan is to keep the master branch deployable at all times. If you wish to use the app in its preliminary mode, you can build and sideload through xcode on a mac. 

As I near a more usable state, I will be doing a testflight beta. Keep an eye hear or the r/Klippers subreddit for details
